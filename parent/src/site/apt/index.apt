About dbUnit

 dbUnit is a JUnit extension (also usable from Ant and Maven)
 targeted for database-driven projects that, among other things,
 puts your database into a known state between test runs.
 This is an excellent way to avoid the myriad of problems that can occur
 when one test case corrupts the database and causes subsequent tests
 to fail or exacerbate the damage.
